because
it is A 
`README.md` (
this file
) appears 
on your GitHub profile
Here are some 
ideas to get you started:- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on multiple repositories and I am a Integrator, cloud specialist,  more I will also include a section of some of my works  but im xsls or csv - ðŸŒ± I
currently learn where life leads turns out sometimes a quest to places unknown you use sometimes more brain cells than you thought possible "imagination"-ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any idea and any sort of code I have worked by myself for so long seems like Iam on a :desert_island:  ðŸ¤” Iam 
looking for help trying to be on a team with someone who is able to receive and give constructive criticism not destructive,  and will offer ideas instead of just letting one person make them by this Iam possibly referring to a code reviewer 
 ðŸ’¬ Ask me about some of my projects which some took long hours and all my original work is not entirely complete as I guess sometimes there is always one thing or another that will say "MINE!" And leave you  with very little you can cqpp your own even well I guess Moore complaining since 03-07 I was 
 in the US Army I did  one tour overseas came back with issues I have since took up many hobbies and picked up different skills still some things can not get worse only better
